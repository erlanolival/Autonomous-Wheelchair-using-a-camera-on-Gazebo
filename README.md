# Autonomous-Wheelchair-using-a-camera-on-Gazebo
This is a project of an autonomous wheelchair using a camera to recognize the objects in the environment. The project is still in the beginning. I am planning to use ultrasound sensor and Lidar sensor to help to detect the obstacles in the environment and avoid collisions. I will be updating the code as soon as possible.
